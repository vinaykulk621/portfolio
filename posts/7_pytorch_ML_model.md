### Hello There 🐼

Let's talk ML model in pytorch 🔥.

___

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
```


#### Pytorch models
1. Inherit `nn.Models` class from pytorch to make any nueral network.
2. Override `forward()` method. This method defines what happens in forward computation.
3. `nn.Parameter` contains what parameters the model should learn.

The above two conditions need to be satisified by any nueral network model in pytorch.
