### My Tech Stack: Next.js 🚀, TailwindCSS 💅, MongoDB 🍃, and a pinch of laziness 😴

____

Hey there! Are you ready to hear about my tech stack? I use Next.js 13, TailwindCSS  💅, and sometimes MongoDB🍃 for my database needs. Now, you might be wondering why I chose Next.js. It's simple: I hated learning React and got stuck with this React framework. Plus, I'm too lazy to learn any other framework out there (oops!).


When it comes to TailwindCSS  💅, it's just so good and simple that it makes me think why I didn't use it from the beginning. And when it comes to databases, well, MongoDB🍃 is my go-to. I have no idea and motivation to learn about all the other shittone of databases that are out there (yup, I said it!). But seriously there are way too many databases out there.However, I would love to learn about Supabase and PlanetScale🌏 as they sound so cool and good.


Now, I can code somewhat in Python🐍 and C, but don't expect me to do object-oriented programming because I suck at it😔. I never understood polymorphism (seriously, who came up with that word?🤦🏻‍♂️).


And now, the thing that I'm most proud of🥹 (drumroll please 🥁) - I have contributed to the Next.js framework repo🎊, and you can find my name in the release version in this [next.js-blog](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-3). You just have to search my GitHub account name [@vinaykulk621](https://github.com/vinaykulk621), and there it is! (Hint: I'm not telling you where to find it, though. You'll have to do some searching yourself!).


In conclusion, my tech stack might not be the most impressive out there, but it gets the job done. And who knows, maybe someday I'll even learn Svelte and Solid frameworks (once I'm done being lazy). Thanks for reading, and don't forget to add some emojis in your code (they make everything better)! 😎👨‍💻🚀


And now for the joke: Why did the programmer quit his job? He didn't get arrays. 😂
