## Xerox Shop
Every guy studying in uni had think opening one and i think this **xerox shop** idea is most scam and profitable idea.Like **Bro**!! you just put text on the paper with a machine and that text too you don't write on your own, The **customerü§ëüíµüí≤üí∏üòªüíìü•∞üòç** only gives it to you.

1. Intial cost - around 5-lakhs to buy a **xerox** machine(big one) and rent a place near some college or ofiice where you will be attracting your customers.
2. Monthly revenue - let's say you get around '150' pages to print in one day that's '45,000' pages in a month and you charge 1 rupee per copy for normal A4 sheet and much higher for diferent copies.

* Book binding: 50Rs(minimum charge).
* Soft binding: 25Rs.
