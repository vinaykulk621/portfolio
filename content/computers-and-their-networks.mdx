### Hello Thereüêº

Let's talk Computer Networks.

![Components-of-CN](/content/CN/components-of-cn.svg)

#### Hub

- It is a device that splits the network connection into multiple devices that are connceted to it.
- Or simply put together, Hub tranfers the request or response to all the devices that are conncted to it.
- It is **Dumb**.

#### Switch

- It is a device that splits the network connection into specific device specified by the sender or reciever.
- Or simply put together, Switch tranfers the request or response to the device to which it is intended to.
- It does so by keeping track of MAC addressess of all the devices that are connected to the switch theough it's ports.
- Switch has something called CAM (Content Addressable Memory) table. Which stores the MAC addressess of the devices connected to it's ports.
- It is **Smart**.

#### Routers

- It is a device that connects the LAN to outside world or so called **The Internet**.
- It is usually used to connect different networks.
- Part of **Network layer**.
- It is very expensive to maintain one.

| Peer-to-Peer                                                                                     | Client / Server                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Equal opportunity to everyone in the network                                                     | Those who are in need only given option to talk with whom they want to talk. |
| ![Peer-to-Peer](/content/CN/peer-to-peer.svg)                                                    | ![Client-Server](/content/CN/client-server.svg)                              |
| If the desired computer is busy in talking to other computer we can not talk to it at that time. | High speed data sharing can take place.                                      |

### Various Network Types

![Network-Types](/content/CN/network-types.svg)

#### PAN

- Personal Area Network.
- Belongs to a person.
- Revolves around a person's personal devices like mobile phone, watch and etc..

#### LAN

- Local Area Network.
- Involves a bunch of computers/devices connected with each other through cables.
- Limits to an office or a room or a building.
- Faster data tranfer takes place.
- Secure as there is no intervention of external entity.

#### MAN

- Metropolitan Area Network.
- Group of LAN's together is called MAN.
- They can be used to connect different branches of a bank in a city together.

#### WAN

- Wide Area Network.
- Spread over large geographical area like states and countries.
- For example **Internet** is a WAN.

#### TCP/IP Model

- When devices want to communicate with each other through internet they must follow a protocol.
- **TCP/IP** provides the methods to brake down the data into packets and share across the internet.
- Layer-1 : [Physical Layer](#physical-layer)
- Layer-2 : [Data-link Layer](#data-link-layer)
- Layer-3 : [Network Layer](#network-layer)
- Layer-4 : [Transport Layer](#transport-layer)
- Layer-5 : [Application Layer](#application-layer)

<br />
<br />

### Physical Layer

- Pyhysical Layer also known as **Layer-1**.
- At the bottom of the TCP/IP layer.
- Responsible for transporting and accepting data from and to the internet.
- It does it so through Cables and radiowaves and stuff.
- Many concepts like What type of signal transportation method is efficient to transfer the data through a channel is discussed here.
- Concepts like Digital data encoding and decoding takes place here.
- Some encoding and decoding techniques like Bipolar, Polar, NRZ, NRZ-I etc..
- **Multiplexing** is a concept of combining various signals into one and sending it through one/multiple channel to achieve efficiency and better performance.
- 3 techniques in Multiplexing _Frequency-division_, _Wavelength-division_ and _Time-division_ multiplexing.
- Concepts like **frame**, **frame length** and _time slots_ occur in _Time-division multiplexing_.
- **Switching** is a concept where the computer signal is sent from one computer netowrk to another computer network.
- Switch uses **MAC** address to forward packets through various network.

<br />

### Data-Link Layer

- Data-Link Layer also known as **Layer-2**.
- Responsible for moving the data frames from one node to another node in the network from source to destination.
- Data link layer has sublayers

  <div className="h-64 w-64">
    ![data-link-layer-sublayers](/content/CN/data-link-layer-sublayers.svg)
  </div>

- LLC(Logical Link control) or DLC(Data Link Control) is responsible for [Flow control](#flow-control)
- MAC sublayer is responsible for:
  - Data Encapsulation:
    - Frame Assemmbly and disassembly is done here.
    - Frames are created here.
    - Header and trailer are added here.
  - Media Access Control:
    - Placing and removing of the frames from the media line.
- Service provided by Data link layer:
  - [Framing](#framing)
  - [Physical addressing](#physical-addressing)
  - [Flow control](#flow-control)
  - [Error control](#error-control)
  - [Access control](#access-control)

<br />

#### Framing

- `Frame = Header + Network Layer PDU(Data) + Trailer`
- Making each data frame that need to be transported unique or distinguishable from each other so that reciever can know what the data is.
- Each frame of data is made unique by adding a header and trailer to the data that need to be sent over the channel.
- The bits which are added at the begining and at the end of the frame is agreed by both sender and reciever.
- We add bunch of bits at the begining and end of the data to mark one data frame. Below figure explains the Framing.
- Notice how in the below figure we have the same header and trailer bit in the data part of the **frame**. It is called <span className="text-red-500">Framing error</span>.
  ![Framing](/content/CN/framing.svg)
- <span className="text-red-500">Framing Error</span> solution:

- **Bit stuffing**
  is used to overcome framing error problem
- Let's say that `1001` is the agreed code to be added in header and trailer of the frame.
- If we encounter `1001` we need to replace it with something else. Like say we replace it with `1011` and let the reciever know that it needs to be converted back to `1001`.
- We might come across `1011` in the data. In this case the reciever will convert it into `1001` but it is not the correct data. To overcome this kind of problem we need to come up with a very strong and reliable **bit stuffing** code.

  <br />

#### Physical addressing

- This layer is responsible for appending header and trailer to the data frame.
- The header contains the MAC address of the source and destination.

#### Flow control

- There need to be a flow control mechanism between sender and reciever so that they both are in sync.
- It is basically the amount of data a sender can send before recieving an acknowledgement from the recever.
- Various Flow control protocols:
  - Simple protocol: Simply just send all the frames that need to be transmitted.
  - Stop-and-wait: After sending a frame wait for the acknowledgement of that frame from the reciever so that you can send next frame in the row.
  - Stop-and-wait-ARQ: It is same as **Stop-and-wait**, The difference is that here we have a timer. After the timer burns out the unacknowledged frame is sent again.
  - Sliding-window: We have a fixed window size of some length say `n`.
    - We send first `n` frmaes and wait for their acknowledgement in the order we sent the frames.
    - If we get the acknowledgement for the first frame we slide the window and send the next frame.
    - If the timer burns out or we get acknowledgement for wrong frame we send back the first frame assuming that there was a problem with the frame transmission.
  - Go-back--ARQ: It is same as Sliding-window as we have a sliding-window here too. The only difference is whenever we get the wrong frame acknowledgement or no acknowledgement we send back all the frames available on our window size.

#### Error control

- Whenever there is an error in the data frames there are two ways to deal with this problem
  1. Error detection
  2. Error Correction
- Types of error:
  1. Bit error: There is one bit difference between original data and the recieved data.
  2. Burst error: Multiple bits difference between original data and the recieved data.
- Error detection can be implemented in data link layer or [Transport-layer](#transport-layer)
- When the recever gets the data it needs to validate that it is correct. It does so with help of **redundancy bits** added with the data.
- **Redundancy bits** are just extra bits added to data from sender to validate the correctness of the data by reciever.
- Some methods of generating **Redundancy bits**:
  - Checksum:
    - You divide the data that need to be sent into `k` parts of size `n`.
    - Then add all `n` parts with each other and take 1's compliment.
    - This 1's compliment is only **redundancy bits** which are sent with the data
    - On the reciever's side the recieved data is added together.
    - If the final value of addition results into `1` at all places then the recieved data is valid.
    - Else it is descarded and notified to the sender.
  - Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC):
    - We have some complicated method to generate the `CRC`.

#### Access control

- When multiple devices are accessing the same channel to send data, we need some mechanism to make sure the data do not collide with each other.

| Random Access protocol | controlled access protocol | Channelization |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Aloha                  | Reserving                  | FDMA           |
| CSMA                   | Polling                    | WDMA           |
| CSMA/CD                | Token Passing              | CDMA           |
| CSMA/CA                |                            |                |
