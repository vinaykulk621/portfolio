### Hello Thereüêº

Let's talk Computer Networks.

![Components-of-CN](/content/CN/components-of-cn.svg)

#### Hub

- It is a device that splits the network connection into multiple devices that are connceted to it.
- Or simply put together, Hub tranfers the request or response to all the devices that are conncted to it.
- It is **Dumb**.

#### Switch

- It is a device that splits the network connection into specific device specified by the sender or reciever.
- Or simply put together, Switch tranfers the request or response to the device to which it is intended to.
- It does so by keeping track of MAC addressess of all the devices that are connected to the switch theough it's ports.
- Switch has something called CAM (Content Addressable Memory) table. Which stores the MAC addressess of the devices connected to it's ports.
- It is **Smart**.

#### Routers

- It is a device that connects the LAN to outside world or so called **The Internet**.
- It is usually used to connect different networks.
- Part of **Network layer**.
- It is very expensive to maintain one.

### Computer Architecture

| Peer-to-Peer                                                                                     | Client / Server                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Equal opportunity to everyone in the network                                                     | Those who are in need only given option to talk with whom they want to talk. |
| ![Peer-to-Peer](/content/CN/peer-to-peer.svg)                                                    | ![Client-Server](/content/CN/client-server.svg)                              |
| If the desired computer is busy in talking to other computer we can not talk to it at that time. | High speed data sharing can take place.                                      |

### Various Network Types

![Network-Types](/content/CN/network-types.svg)

#### PAN

- Personal Area Network.
- Belongs to a person.
- Revolves around a person's personal devices like mobile phone, watch and etc..

#### LAN

- Local Area Network.
- Involves a bunch of computers/devices connected with each other through cables.
- Limits to an office or a room or a building.
- Faster data tranfer takes place.
- Secure as there is no intervention of external entity.

#### MAN

- Metropolitan Area Network.
- Group of LAN's together is called MAN.
- They can be used to connect different branches of a bank in a city together.

#### WAN

- Wide Area Network.
- Spread over large geographical area like states and countries.
- For example **Internet** is a WAN.

#### TCP/IP Model

- When devices want to communicate with each other through internet they must follow a protocol.
- **TCP/IP** provides the methods to brake down the data into packets and share across the internet.
- Layer-1 : [Physical Layer](#physical-layer)
- Layer-2 : [Data-link Layer](#data-link-layer)
- Layer-3 : [Network Layer](#network-layer)
- Layer-4 : [Transport Layer](#transport-layer)
- Layer-5 : [Application Layer](#application-layer)

<br />
<br />

### Physical Layer

- Pyhysical Layer also known as **Layer-1**.
- At the bottom of the TCP/IP layer.
- Responsible for transporting and accepting data from and to the internet.
- It does it so through Cables and radiowaves and stuff.
- Many concepts like What type of signal transportation method is efficient to transfer the data through a channel is discussed here.
- Concepts like Digital data encoding and decoding takes place here.
- Some encoding and decoding techniques like Bipolar, Polar, NRZ, NRZ-I etc..
- **Multiplexing** is a concept of combining various signals into one and sending it through one/multiple channel to achieve efficiency and better performance.
- 3 techniques in Multiplexing _Frequency-division_, _Wavelength-division_ and _Time-division_ multiplexing.
- Concepts like **frame**, **frame length** and _time slots_ occur in _Time-division multiplexing_.
- **Switching** is a concept where the computer signal is sent from one computer netowrk to another computer network.
- Switch uses **MAC** address to forward packets through various network.

<br />

### Data-Link Layer

- Data-Link Layer also known as **Layer-2**.
