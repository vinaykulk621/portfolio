### Hello Thereüêº

Let's talk Computer Networks.

---

![Components-of-CN](/content/CN/components-of-CN.svg)

#### Hub

- It is a device that splits the network connection into multiple devices that are connceted to it.
- Or simply put together, Hub tranfers the request or response to all the devices that are conncted to it.
- It is **Dumb**.

#### Switch

- It is a device that splits the network connection into specific device specified by the sender or reciever.
- Or simply put together, Switch tranfers the request or response to the device to which it is intended to.
- It does so by keeping track of MAC addressess of all the devices that are connected to the switch theough it's ports.
- Switch has something called CAM (Content Addressable Memory) table. Which stores the MAC addressess of the devices connected to it's ports.
- It is **Smart**.

#### Routers

- It is a device that connects the LAN to outside world or so called **The Internet**.
- It is usually used to connect different networks.
- Part of **Network layer**.
- It is very expensive to maintain one.

| Peer-to-Peer                                                                                     | Client / Server                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Equal opportunity to everyone in the network                                                     | Those who are in need only given option to talk with whom they want to talk. |
| ![Peer-to-Peer](/content/CN/peer-to-peer.svg)                                                    | ![Client-Server](/content/CN/client-server.svg)                              |
| If the desired computer is busy in talking to other computer we can not talk to it at that time. | High speed data sharing can take place.                                      |

### Various Network Types

![Network-Types](/content/CN/network-types.svg)

#### PAN

- Personal Area Network.
- Belongs to a person.
- Revolves around a person's personal devices like mobile phone, watch and etc..

#### LAN

- Local Area Network.
- Involves a bunch of computers/devices connected with each other through cables.
- Limits to an office or a room or a building.
- Faster data tranfer takes place.
- Secure as there is no intervention of external entity.

#### MAN

- Metropolitan Area Network.
- Group of LAN's together is called MAN.
- They can be used to connect different branches of a bank in a city together.

#### WAN

- Wide Area Network.
- Spread over large geographical area like states and countries.
- For example **Internet** is a WAN.

</MdxCard>

#### TCP/IP Model

- When devices want to communicate with each other through internet they must follow a protocol.
- **TCP/IP** provides the methods to brake down the data into packets and share across the internet.
- Layer-1 : [Physical Layer](#physical-layer)
- Layer-2 : [Data-link Layer](#data-link-layer)
- Layer-3 : [Network Layer](#network-layer)
- Layer-4 : [Transport Layer](#transport-layer)
- Layer-5 : [Application Layer](#application-layer)

<br />
<br />

## Physical Layer

- Pyhysical Layer also known as **Layer-1**.
- At the bottom of the TCP/IP layer.
- Responsible for transporting and accepting data from and to the internet.
- It does it so through Cables and radiowaves and stuff.
- Many concepts like What type of signal transportation method is efficient to transfer the data through a channel is discussed here.
- Concepts like Digital data encoding and decoding takes place here.
- Some encoding and decoding techniques like Bipolar, Polar, NRZ, NRZ-I etc..
- **Multiplexing** is a concept of combining various signals into one and sending it through one/multiple channel to achieve efficiency and better performance.
- 3 techniques in Multiplexing _Frequency-division_, _Wavelength-division_ and _Time-division_ multiplexing.
- Concepts like **frame**, **frame length** and _time slots_ occur in _Time-division multiplexing_.
- **Switching** is a concept where the computer signal is sent from one computer netowrk to another computer network.
- Switch uses **MAC** address to forward packets through various network.

<br />

## Data-Link Layer

- Data-Link Layer also known as **Layer-2**.
- Responsible for moving the data frames from one node to another node in the network from source to destination.
- You can also call it Hop-to-Hop delivery of the data.
- Data link layer has sublayers

  <div className="h-64 w-64">
    ![data-link-layer-sublayers](/content/CN/data-link-layer-sublayers.svg)
  </div>

- LLC(Logical Link control) or DLC(Data Link Control) is responsible for [Flow control](#flow-control)
- MAC sublayer is responsible for:
  - Data Encapsulation:
    - Frame Assemmbly and disassembly is done here.
    - Frames are created here.
    - Header and trailer are added here.
  - Media Access Control:
    - Placing and removing of the frames from the media line.
- Service provided by Data link layer:
  - [Framing](#framing)
  - [Physical addressing](#physical-addressing)
  - [Flow control](#flow-control)
  - [Error control](#error-control)
  - [Access control](#access-control)

<br />

#### Framing

- `Frame = Header + Network Layer PDU(Data) + Trailer`
- Making each data frame that need to be transported unique or distinguishable from each other so that reciever can know what the data is.
- Each frame of data is made unique by adding a header and trailer to the data that need to be sent over the channel.
- The bits which are added at the begining and at the end of the frame is agreed by both sender and reciever.
- We add bunch of bits at the begining and end of the data to mark one data frame. Below figure explains the Framing.
- Notice how in the below figure we have the same header and trailer bit in the data part of the **frame**. It is called <span className="text-red-500">Framing error</span>.
  ![Framing](/content/CN/framing.svg)
- <span className="text-red-500">Framing Error</span> solution:

- **Bit stuffing**
  is used to overcome framing error problem
- Let's say that `1001` is the agreed code to be added in header and trailer of the frame.
- If we encounter `1001` we need to replace it with something else. Like say we replace it with `1011` and let the reciever know that it needs to be converted back to `1001`.
- We might come across `1011` in the data. In this case the reciever will convert it into `1001` but it is not the correct data. To overcome this kind of problem we need to come up with a very strong and reliable **bit stuffing** code.

<br />

#### Physical addressing

- This layer is responsible for appending header and trailer to the data frame.
- The header contains the MAC addresss of each node in between source and destination.

<br />

#### Flow control

- There need to be a flow control mechanism between sender and reciever so that they both are in sync.
- It is basically the amount of data a sender can send before recieving an acknowledgement from the recever.
- Various Flow control protocols:
  - Simple protocol: Simply just send all the frames that need to be transmitted.
  - Stop-and-wait: After sending a frame wait for the acknowledgement of that frame from the reciever so that you can send next frame in the row.
  - Stop-and-wait-ARQ: It is same as **Stop-and-wait**, The difference is that here we have a timer. After the timer burns out the unacknowledged frame is sent again.
  - Sliding-window: We have a fixed window size of some length say `n`.
    - We send first `n` frmaes and wait for their acknowledgement in the order we sent the frames.
    - If we get the acknowledgement for the first frame we slide the window and send the next frame.
    - If the timer burns out or we get acknowledgement for wrong frame we send back the first frame assuming that there was a problem with the frame transmission.
  - Go-back--ARQ: It is same as Sliding-window as we have a sliding-window here too. The only difference is whenever we get the wrong frame acknowledgement or no acknowledgement we send back all the frames available on our window size.

<br />

#### Error control

- Whenever there is an error in the data frames there are two ways to deal with this problem
  1. Error detection
  2. Error Correction
- Types of error:
  1. Bit error: There is one bit difference between original data and the recieved data.
  2. Burst error: Multiple bits difference between original data and the recieved data.
- Error detection can be implemented in data link layer or [Transport-layer](#transport-layer)
- When the recever gets the data it needs to validate that it is correct. It does so with help of **redundancy bits** added with the data.
- **Redundancy bits** are just extra bits added to data from sender to validate the correctness of the data by reciever.
- Some methods of generating **Redundancy bits**:
  - Checksum:
    - You divide the data that need to be sent into `k` parts of size `n`.
    - Then add all `n` parts with each other and take 1's compliment.
    - This 1's compliment is only **redundancy bits** which are sent with the data
    - On the reciever's side the recieved data is added together.
    - If the final value of addition results into `1` at all places then the recieved data is valid.
    - Else it is descarded and notified to the sender.
  - Cyclic Redundancy Check(CRC):
    - We have some complicated method to generate the `CRC`.

<br />

#### Access control

- When multiple devices are accessing the same channel to send data, we need some mechanism to make sure the data do not collide with each other.

| Random Access protocol | controlled access protocol | Channelization |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Aloha                  | Reserving                  | FDMA           |
| CSMA                   | Polling                    | WDMA           |
| CSMA/CD                | Token Passing              | CDMA           |
| CSMA/CA                |                            |                |

<br />
<br />

## Network Layer

- Network Layer also known as **Layer-3**.
- It's main role is to deliver packets from source host to destination host.
- In this layer IP addresses are discussed. This layer uses IP address to deliver the packets.
- Makes sure the destination recieves data in the same order the sender has sent.
- It provides the path for the data packets to travel through various networks(Routing).
- Main functions performed by network layer:
  - Routing
  - Logical addressing
  - Inter networking
  - Fragmentation

<br />

### IP address

- It is a logical address which is used to identify the device's connection to the internet.
- There are two types of IP addresses
  1. [`IPV4`](#ipv4)- **32 bits**
  2. [`IPV6`](#ipv6)- **128 bits**

<br />

#### IPV4

- We can assign IP addresses <code>2<sup>32</sup></code> devices.
- There are two types of address:
  1. [**Classfull** addressing](#classfull-addressing)
  2. [**Classless** addressing](#classless-addressing)

<br />

### Classfull addressing

- Here the size of the hosts and networks are limited and fixed.
- We may waste the number of IP addresses present in the given network.
- For big organizations a monolothic address space is given. Which might not fit the organizations need and underlying architecture.
- There are 5 types of **Classfull** addresses here

| Class | Range   | Usage     | Subnet Mask   | No of n/w                   | No of Hosts                      |
| ----- | ------- | --------- | ------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **A** | 0-127   | General   | 255.0.0.0     | <code>2<sup>7</sup></code>  | <code>2<sup>32-7</sup>-2</code>  |
| **B** | 128-191 | General   | 255.255.0.0   | <code>2<sup>17</sup></code> | <code>2<sup>32-14</sup>-2</code> |
| **C** | 192-223 | General   | 255.255.255.0 | <code>2<sup>21</sup></code> | <code>2<sup>32-21</sup>-2</code> |
| **D** | 224-239 | Broadcast | -             | -                           | -                                |
| **E** | 224-255 | /Research | -             | -                           | -                                |

- Subnet mask is used to identify the class of the address.
- For each class the subnet is unique and can be identified in two ways:

  | Class | Binary notation | Slash notation |
  | ----- | --------------- | -------------- |
  | **A** | **0**0000000    | `/8`           |
  | **B** | **10**000000    | `/16`          |
  | **C** | **110**00000    | `/24`          |

- **The First and last address in each class os reserved and is not for Usage**

  - First address for example `127.0.0.0` for `class-A` is used to identify the netowrk.
  - Last address is used to brodcast data to all the other devices present in the network.

- **localhost /`127.0.0.1`**

  - It is used a special IP address.
  - Used to direct traffic to themselves.

- IPV4 Transmission types:

  - unicast, multicast and broadcast

  | unicast                                                             | multicast                                                  | broadcast                                            |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
  | Can only talk to one device which is connected to the same network. | Can talk to multiple hosts in possible different networks. | Will talk to all the devices present in the network. |

- It is impossible to give unique address to each device in the world.
- Here the concept of private and public IP address comes into picture.
- Devices which need not connect to the internet can use private IP addresses.
- But, what if that device want to connect to the internet???
- This can be achieved via connceting the device to a Proxy server or a router which has **NAT** setup init.
- What **NAT** basically does is, It maps out the **private IP address** to **public IP address** of the router and handles the request.
- Few Private IP addresses:

  | Address                                              |
  | ---------------------------------------------------- |
  | `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255` (`10.0.0.0/8`)         |
  | `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255` (`172.16.0.0/12`)    |
  | `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255` (`192.168.0.0/16`) |

<br />

### Classless addressing

- Formal name of classless addressing is known as CIDR(classless-Inter-domain-routing).
- It allowes ISP to allocate IP address with any address bit-boundary(prefix length).
- It allows us to create our own network with the number of devices needed in the network.
- Subnetting:

  - Dividing a network into 2 or more networks is Subnetting.
  - Sub network is a logical division of the network.

- Subnet masks:

  - Possible values for subnet mask
    ![TCP/IP-model](/content/CN/subnet-value.svg)
  - It is used to divide the `network` and `host` part of the IP address.
  - It is a `32-bit` number constructed with all 1's at the begining and 0's at the end.
  - `/`-notaion is used to represent the subnet mask
  - `/3` --> `11100000 00000000 00000000 00000000`

<br />

#### Problems on Subnetting

There are few steps to be followed to calculate the number of IP addresses in a subnet

1. Given the IP address figure out how many devices need to be there in a given subnet.
2. Convert the number of devices into binary format. For example we need to address `32` devices then we convert `32` into Binary format which is `100000`.
3. Count the minimum number of bits required to denote the number of devices in Binary format. Call it `n`. For the above example it will be `6`.
4. To represent the new subnet mask in `/`-notation, Just do `32 - n`.
5. Make the new range of IP addresses from the new `/`-notation.

<br />

#### IPV6

- **128** bits long.

![IPV6](/content/CN/IPV6.svg)

<br />

### Network Layer Protocols:

Few protocols which network layer provides.

#### ARP(Address Resolution Protocol)

- It is a protocol used to get the MAC address of other devices present in the network which is essential for communication between two devices in the same or different network.
- The sender or host who wants to know the MAC address will send a brodcast message to all the devices in the network.
- The one to whom the broadcast is intended to responds back with it's MAC address.

#### ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol)

- It is a protocol used to send notifications of IP datagram packets.
- It's main functionality is to alert the router about the problem but not to fix them.
- It has the least priority over all other protocols.

#### IGMP(Internet Group Message Protocol)

- It is a protocol used to identify the members of a group in LAN.
- It is essential in multicast addressing.
- In multicast addressing data needs to be tranmitted to multiple hosts. IGMP is essential to identify the devices in the network.

<br />

## Transport Layer

- Responsible for transporting data to the correct process running on the destination's computer.
- Uses port number to identify the process.

![PortNumbers](/content/CN/portNumbers.svg)

- We have **Error control**, **Flow control** and **Access control** defined in this layer.
- This layer deals with process to process communication that's why we need it here.
- `Socket-address = IP address + Port number`
- Purpose of **Socket address** is to uniquely identify each process running

<MdxCard className='text-white'>

**Error control** and **Flow control** are defined in both [Transport layer](#transport-layer) and [Data Link Layer](#data-link-layer) because:

1. [Transport layer](#transport-layer) deals with Process to Process communication. There need to be flow and error control while transfering the data.
2. [Data Link layer](#data-link-layer) deals with **node-to-node** transportation of data hence we need flow and error control.

</MdxCard>

- There are two major protocols used in transport layer: [TCP](#tcp) and [UDP](#udp).

<br />

#### TCP

- **Transmission control protocol**.
- TCP is a communication standard over which enables application programs to excahnge data over the internet.
- This communication standard requires a connection to be made before transmission of any data.
- Offers byte streaming. i.e; Sender sends the data through the connection.
- It has a **FULL DUPLEX** transmission method.
- We can piggyback the acknowledgement and data.
- Has **Error Control**
- Has **Flow Control**

Three-way-handshake connection mechanism:

![Three-way](/content/CN/Three-way.svg)

#### UDP

- **User Datagram protocol**.
- **UDP** does not require a connection to be made before transmission of the data(UDP is a connectionless protocol).
- **UDP** is **<span className='text-red-500'>not reliable</span>** as it does not offer **Error control**, **Congestion control** and **Flow control**.
- **UDP** is **<span className='text-green-500'>Faster</span>** than **TCP** as it does not require a large header.

Applications:

- Streaming videos(Youtube live stream) as we need speed transmission of the data.
- Single request and response protocols(RIP).
