### Hello There üêº

Let's make a cool 3D webpage using Three-js in Next.js 13.

---

Start off with creating a new `Next-js` project with app-dir and install three-js.
Here i am using `JS`, `tailwindCSS` and `Next-js 13.2` with app-directory.

```shell title="terminal" showLineNumbers
npx create-next-app@latest
npm i three
```

---

### Next steps

1. Navigate to `/app/page.js` and clean up the starter code.
2. Make a `Three.js` component file in `/app` directory (`/app/Three.js`).
3. `Three.js` is the file where we will be writing our `three-js` code.

populate `/app/Three.js` with the following starter code.

```js title="/app/Three.js"
export default function Three() {
  return <>Three-js code goes here</>
}
```

go ahead and import this component in `/app/page.js`.

```js title="/app/page.js"
import Three from './Three'

export default function Home() {
  return <Three />
}
```

**Note**:
In the next following steps you will be editing `/app/Three.js` file.

---

### Next-steps

1. Creating a scene in Three-js.
2. Adding some 3D geometry to the webpage.

You can think of your 3D scene as a movie shooting session. Where you are required to have a camera, a scene and film in the camera to capture the movie. Similarly here in Three-js you need a `camera`, a `scene` and a `renderer`. We need to create these three things.

<Callout>
  populate `/app/Three.js` page with the following code that sets up our scene
  in three-js.
</Callout>

```js title="/app/Three.js"
'use client'
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import * as THREE from 'three'

export default function Three() {
  const sceneRef = useRef(null)
  const cameraRef = useRef(null)
  const rendererRef = useRef(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    sceneRef.current = new THREE.Scene()
    cameraRef.current = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
      75,
      window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
      0.1,
      1000
    )
    rendererRef.current = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true })
  }, [])
  return <>Three-js cool.</>
}
```

---

#### Next-steps

1. Using the scene that was created to render something on the screen.
2. Making a SphereGeometry.
3. Rendering the SphereGeometry on the page.

In the following code block you are rendering your 3D geometry as soon as you load the page. This is achieved by `useEffect()` hook. In this hook call you are setting the renderer's size viz, `window.size` and pushing the 3D object to the end of the page.

```js title="/app/Three.js"
'use client'
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import * as THREE from 'three'

export default function Three() {
  const sceneRef = useRef(null)
  const cameraRef = useRef(null)
  const rendererRef = useRef(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    sceneRef.current = new THREE.Scene()
    cameraRef.current = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
      75,
      window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
      0.1,
      1000
    )
    rendererRef.current = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true })
  }, [])

  // New Code Here
  useEffect(() => {
    const scene = sceneRef.current
    const camera = cameraRef.current
    const renderer = rendererRef.current

    renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight)

    document.body.after(renderer.domElement)
  }, [])
  return <></>
}
```

## Making the SphereGeometry

The simplest geometry in three-js is a **ball** i.e; [SphereGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/SphereGeometry).

Sphere geometry takes a bunch of parameters in it's constructor while creating it. Explore around the documentation [here](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation) to figure out how you can customize your **Ball**.

The following code creates a **Ball** and adds it to the scene.

```js title="/app/Three.js"
const geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(15, 32, 16)
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffff00 })
const sphere = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
scene.add(sphere)
```

Now for the final step you can copy the following code block to your `/app/Three.js` file and run `npm run dev`.

```js title="/app/Three.js"
'use client'
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import * as THREE from 'three'

export default function Three() {
  const sceneRef = useRef(null)
  const cameraRef = useRef(null)
  const rendererRef = useRef(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    sceneRef.current = new THREE.Scene()
    cameraRef.current = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
      75,
      window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
      0.1,
      1000
    )
    rendererRef.current = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true })
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    const scene = sceneRef.current
    const camera = cameraRef.current
    const renderer = rendererRef.current

    renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight)

    document.body.after(renderer.domElement)

    // New Code Here
    const geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(15, 32, 16)
    const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xffff00 })
    const ball = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
    scene.add(ball)

    const animate = () => {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate)
      renderer.render(scene, camera)
    }

    animate()
  }, [])

  return <></>
}
```

And That's It Folk now you have a **ball** on your screen.

**Fun-Note**

> you can wrap your **ball** with any picture to make it look cool. Or make it look like a planet or a star or anything that comes to your imagination. Let's make a **moon** üåö,

<Callout>
  you can get the üåö `jpg` from [here](https://tinyurl.com/spj4rujm).
</Callout>

```js title="/api/Three.js"
'use client' import React, {(useRef, useEffect)} from
'react' import * as THREE from 'three'

export default function Three() {
  const sceneRef = useRef(null)
  const cameraRef = useRef(null)
  const rendererRef = useRef(null)

useEffect(() => {
sceneRef.current = new THREE.Scene()
cameraRef.current = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
75,
window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
0.1,
1000
)
rendererRef.current = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true })
}, [])

useEffect(() => {
const scene = sceneRef.current
const camera = cameraRef.current
const renderer = rendererRef.current

    renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight)

    document.body.after(renderer.domElement)

    // New Code Here
    const moonImg = 'https://tinyurl.com/spj4rujm'

    const ball = new THREE.Mesh(
      new THREE.SphereGeometry(10, 150, 20),
      new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
        map: new THREE.TextureLoader().load(moonImg),
      })
    )

    scene.add(ball)

    const animate = () => {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate)

      // Rotating the Moon around it's own axis
      ball.rotation.x += 0.01

      renderer.render(scene, camera)
    }

    animate()

}, [])

return <></>
}

```

That's it For Now folks. Maybe in not so far future i might make a something like `npx create-next-three`.

Good Day
