### Hello Thereüêº

Let's talk Database management.

---

<Callout>
  In this blog we will talk about Basics and advanced concepts related to
  **database management** and **SQL**.
</Callout>

## ![Database](/content/DBMS/database.svg)

We have a lot of things in DBMS. we are going to cover few important ones here.

- [Cardinallity and it's ratio](#cardinallity-and-it's-ratio)
- [Keys](#keys)
- [SQL](#sql)

### Cardinallity and it's ratio

- **Cardinallity** is a measure to represt how the entities are related to each other.
- There are 4 types of cardinality ratio:
  1. One-to-One
  2. One-to-Many
  3. Many-to-One
  4. Many-to-Many

### Keys

- Keys play an important role in Database.
- There are various keys:

<div className="flex flex-row gap-x-20">
<div>

1. [Super key](#super-key)
2. [Candidate key](#candidate-key)
3. [Primary key](#primary-key)
4. [Unique key](#unique-key)
5. [Foreign key](#foreign-key)

</div>

   </div>

#### Super key

- All possible key combinations in a table or a realtion are known as super keys.
- It's like a superset of all keys.

#### Candidate key

- It is a subset of all minimal super keys.
- All **candidate keys** as **super keys**.

#### Primary key

- Subset of candidate keys who's value can not be null.
- A unique attribute in a table which can be used to identify all other keys in the table.
- All primary keys are **Candidate keys**.
- The value can not be null.

#### Unique key

- Subset of **Candidate keys** which are not **primary key**
- Value can be null.

#### Foreign key

- The attribute from one table which is refferenced in other table.
- It can only take values which are defined in the parent table.
- A foreign key is allways reffering a primary key of other table.

### Joins

### SQL

- Structured Query Language.
- Used to talk with the database.
- Multiple types of commands are there in SQL, Mainly
  1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
  2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)
  3. DCL (Data Control Language)
  4. TCL (Transaction Control Language)

| DDL                                                                                                 | DML                                                                                  | DCL                                                                                             | TCL                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Commands which are used to defines the data. Like **TABLES**, **DATABASE**, **VIEWS**, **TRIGGERS** | Commands which are used to Manipulate the existing data. Like **UPDATE**, **INSERT** | Commands which are used to control the behaviour or charecteristics of the data. Like **GRANT** | Commands which are used to control transactions in the database. Like **COMMMIT** |
| **CREATE**                                                                                          | **INSERT**                                                                           | **GRANT**                                                                                       | **COMMIT**                                                                        |
| **DROP**                                                                                            | **UPDATE**                                                                           | **REVOKE**                                                                                      | --                                                                                |
| **ALTER**                                                                                           | **DELETE**                                                                           | --                                                                                              | --                                                                                |
