# Xerox Shop

Every guy studying in uni had think opening one and i think this **xerox shop** idea is most scam and profitable idea.Like **Bro**!! you just put text on the paper with a machine and that text too you don't write on your own, The **customerü§ëüíµüí≤üí∏üòªüíìü•∞üòç** only gives it to you.

1. Initial cost - around 5-lakhs to buy a **xerox** machine(big one) and rent a place near some college or office where you will be attracting your customers.
2. Monthly revenue - let's say you get around '150' pages to print in one day that's '45,000' pages in a month and you charge 1 rupee per copy for normal A4 sheet and much higher for different size of paper copies.

For example:

- coloured papers: 3Rs.
- Bigger paper size: 5-20Rs.
- Smaller paper size(micro xerox): 5-10Rs.
- Book binding: 50Rs(minimum charge).
- Soft binding: 25Rs.

your revenue will be easily more than 1,00,000Rs per month.

What about maintenance charges tho?

# Egg Rice stall

Many students and day workers who have a strict schedule prefer quick food. What can be quicker than an egg rice made on a road side stall. Believe me there is lot of scope and place to grow in this business.

**Make egg rice** <br />

1. Get eggs.
2. Get rice.
3. Crack the egg in oil and other masalas.
4. While the egg in the pan is still **wet** add rice and mix it well.
5. Make sure you taste check before adding additional masalas.
6. 'Optional' You can make it healthy by adding some vegetables to it.
7. Serve it with cut 'onions' and some other things you can afford to prepare.

<br />

> Menu

- Egg rice(full): 40Rs.
- Egg rice(half): 30Rs.
- Egg rice(no egg): 35Rs.
- Boiled egg(whole): 10Rs.
- Boiled egg(yolk): 5Rs.
- Bread-Omelette: 25Rs.
- Omelette: 20Rs.

<br />

1. Initial cost - Around 1,00,000Rs to buy a good looking stall, utensils and maybe a place you want to rent where you want to make egg rice. You might want to find some empty place on some road side and start cooking.
2. Monthly revenue - Looking at your menu and your hygienic cooking skills let's say you get around 40 customers in one day. That's around roughly 1600-4000Rs per day, 48,000-1,20,000Rs per month. After getting a bunch of customers you can increase the prices and make egg rice with low quality rice and oil. You can make friends with the people who sell eggs and convince them to sell you eggs for cheaper price.
